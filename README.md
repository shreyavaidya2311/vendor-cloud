## Our Inspiration

Our project aims to help provide small businesses with a platform to allow them to run their shops virtually. The inspiration behind this project was the current pandemic situation. In these times people hesitate to go to local stores like they used to before. To help the small businesses to recover from this loss, we have built an app that lets them run their shop online without any hassle whatsoever.

## What our app does

Vendor Cloud lets the small business owners register their shops on our virtual platform and gives them access to their inventory providing various features to add, edit, and delete products. In the dashboard, they can also view the orders placed by the customers.

On the user side, our main component is a map that shows you all the local shops around you and lets you visit stores virtually. Placing orders and order history are components in the making.

## Technologies used

We built this app using MERN Stack and used Material-UI library for UI designing.

## What's next for VendorCloud

We have big plans for Vendor Cloud. We will be working towards adding new features involving web scraping and making the app as user friendly as possible!
